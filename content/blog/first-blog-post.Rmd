Finally, after a few days of troubleshooting, I have succeeded in launching my first website with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>!   

My current setup is <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> + Hugo + <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">Blogdown</a> as described in this excellent <a href="https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/Making_Site/"> tutorial</a> by <a href="https://github.com/ProQuestionAsker">Amber Thomas</a>. This allows me to create rich web content by utilizing <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">Rmarkdown</a> files with the blogdown package in Rstudio. I chose to use Hugo because it produces static websites. The idea of a static website is that websites are viewed far more often than they are edited, hence the building is only done when the content is created.
