<p>Finally, after a few days of troubleshooting, I have succeeded in launching my first website with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>!</p>
<p>My current setup is <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> + Hugo + <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">Blogdown</a> as described in this excellent <a href="https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/Making_Site/"> tutorial</a> by <a href="https://github.com/ProQuestionAsker">Amber Thomas</a>. This allows me to create rich web content by utilizing <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">Rmarkdown</a> files with the blogdown package in Rstudio.</p>
<p>This is a R chunk. I can for example add two numbers like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>1 + 3 </code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 4</code></pre>
<p>As this Rmarkdown file is essentially an extended version of markdown it is also still possible to use plain html markup, and create beautiful mathematical equations in <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a>: <span class="math display">\[ e^{\pi i} -1 = 0 \]</span> I chose to use Hugo because I saw that recently many websites had migrated to it. The main feature of Hugo is that it produces static websites. The idea of a static website is that websites are viewed far more often than they are edited, hence the building is only done when the content is created. Another important feature of Hugo are the hundreds of themes that are available through the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">theme gallery</a>. Most themes are not that interesting, however, there are some very great ones to choose from. I decided to use the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/beautifulhugo/">beautiful hugo</a> theme.</p>
