<p>And let there be ligth!</p>
<p>After a few days of troubleshooting, I have finally succeeded in launching my first website with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, hurray!</p>
<div id="website-setup" class="section level3">
<h3>Website setup</h3>
<p>I will start this website off by giving a brief overview of my current setup and stating my inentions for the shorter-term.</p>
<p>My current setup is <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> + Hugo + <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">Blogdown</a> as recommended in this excellent <a href="https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/Making_Site/"> tutorial</a> by <a href="https://github.com/ProQuestionAsker">Amber Thomas</a>. This allows me to create rich web content by utilizing <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">Rmarkdown</a> files with the blogdown package in Rstudio. This smoothly integrates with my personal data analysis projects that are mainly done in the R statistical programming language. As an Rmarkdown file is essentially an extended version of markdown it is also still possible to include plain html markup, and create beautiful mathematical equations with <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a>.</p>
<p>I chose to use Hugo because it solves many of the shortcommings of competitors like Jekyll and Wordpress. The main advantage of Hugo is that it produces static websites. The idea of a static website is that websites are viewed far more often than they are edited, hence the building is only done when the content is created. Another important feature of Hugo are the hundreds of themes that are available through the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">theme gallery</a>. Most themes are a bit basic, however, there are some very great ones to choose from. <del>I decided to use the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/beautifulhugo/">beautiful hugo</a> theme</del> <em>Edit: Shortly after starting up my website I switched to the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-lithium-theme/">lithium</a> theme because it better fits my needs</em>. Out of the box, this theme comes with lots of functionality. For example, there is the possibility to integrate Disqus, a dynamic forum-like framework, and Google Analytics, which is a tool that gives detailed insight in the userbase of a website.</p>

<h3>Website roadmap</h3>
<p>My intention, for now, is to publish both meta, that means things concerned with my personal life and/or the organization of this webpage, and new content posts.</p>
