### Getting to know me

I am Robbert-Jan 't Hoen, a 22 year old student living in the neighbourhood of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. I hold a bachelor in Econometrics and Operations Research, and am currently pursuing a master in Quantitative Finance. My interests are mainly concerned with mathematics, statistics, machine learning, renewable energy, healthcare, new technologies, and almost all sports. 

### Purpose of the website

My motivation for building this website is threefold:

- To track my progress
- To later on remember me of past endeavours
- To motivate/inspire/help others
